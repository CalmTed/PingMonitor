Bugs
+dont open from the same data localstorage
+dont open from .json file
?-dont show ping time stats only ttl:59

Plan for MultyWindow:

Main
+1.get data from storage if exists (if not ignore sending data to windows -> send useLocal)
+2.open n windows from data.length
+3.send data to open for each window
+4.:onNewWindow    <=every win have data for each other win
+   if storage have info for this win : sendDataToWin else 'useLocal'
+5.:onWindowClosing
+   resort and rename all windows
+6.:onOpenFile
+  if data is old(for one window)
+    create only one new window
+  else recreate all windows and send data to them
+7.:onSaveFile getInfoFromAllWindows and save to one file once
+  when resived from last window - save file
!if localStorage have "data-[id+1]"   <= its better to be centralized
   call to open one more window

Interfaces:
Main=>Win  +sendRowsToWin:rowData:winData
           +              rowData:'useLocal'
           +sendIdTOWin:  winId:id
           +requestInfoFromWin:'rowData' || 'winId'

Win=>Main  +sendDataToMain:'file',rowData
           sendDataToMain:'storage',rowData

Window
+1.:onCreation
+  if resived "useLocal" try to open from localStorage
+     if not exists, open from config
+  if resived dataToOpen
+     check validity
+     openDataRows
+2.:onSaving
+  sendDataToMain:rowData
!3.:onChanging
  sendDataToMainStorage:rowData

  TO DO
  +clear old comments
  +remove console.log
  +add trys
  +ttls
  +light mode + dynamic styling
  +sorting
  +icons for home and for buttons
  +flex for 5 rows, 4?
  +dynamic localization from the main process
  +mute for each row
  +if ttl=-1 ??
  +sort data.rows after drag and drop event
