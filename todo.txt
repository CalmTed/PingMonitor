Plan for MultyWindow:

Main
+1.get data from storage if exists (if not ignore sending data to windows -> send useLocal)
+2.open n windows from data.length
+3.send data to open for each window
-4.:onNewWindow    <=every win have data for each other win
-   if storage have info for this win : sendDataToWin else 'useLocal'
5.:onWindowClosing
   resort and rename all windows
+6.:onOpenFile
+  if data is old(for one window)
+    create only one new window
+  else recreate all windows and send data to them
+7.:onSaveFile getInfoFromAllWindows and save to one file once
+  when resived from last window - save file
-if localStorage have "data-[id+1]"   <= its better to be centralized
   call to open one more window

Interfaces:
Main=>Win  +sendRowsToWin:rowData:winData
           +              rowData:'useLocal'
           +sendIdTOWin:  winId:id
           +requestInfoFromWin:'rowData' || 'winId'

Win=>Main  +sendDataToMain:'file',rowData
           sendDataToMain:'storage',rowData

Window
1.:onCreation
+  if resived "useLocal" try to open from localStorage
+     if not exists, open from config
  if resived dataToOpen
     check validity
     openDataRows
+2.:onSaving
+  sendDataToMain:rowData
3.:onChanging
  sendDataToMainStorage:rowData
